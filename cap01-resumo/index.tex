This article presents a review of the use of Web Scraping together with Artificial Intelligence (AI), highlighting its importance for Data Science. Web Scraping is discussed within the Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) process, focusing on the extraction stage, and also in more recent applications such as Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) architectures, which use vector databases to expand the knowledge of large language models (LLMs). Legal and ethical aspects are also discussed, considering regulations such as the LGPD, along with practical applications at different organizational levels: operational, tactical, and strategic. The work also shows the evolution of the topic, from the first forms of automation to its current commercial stage. It is concluded that Web Scraping, when combined with AI, is not only useful for data collection but also becomes a strategic resource for innovation and competitiveness, reinforcing its relevance in the field of Data Science.
