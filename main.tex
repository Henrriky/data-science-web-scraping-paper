\section{Page layout and style}

The page layout should match with the following rules. A highly
recommended way to meet these requirements is to use one of the
templates provided and to check details against this example
file. Do not modify the template layout! Do not reduce the line spacing!

If for some reason you cannot use any of the templates, please
follow these rules as carefully as possible, or contact the
organizers at \mbox{$<$info@odyssey2026.org$>$} for further
instructions.

\subsection{Basic layout features}

\begin{itemize}
\item Proceedings will be printed in A4 format. The layout is
designed so that the papers, when printed in US Letter format, will include
all material but the margins will not be symmetric. PLEASE TRY TO MAKE YOUR
SUBMISSION IN A4 FORMAT, if possible, although this is not an
absolute requirement.
\item Two columns are used except for the title part and possibly for large figures that may need a full page width.
\item Left margin is \SI{20}{\milli\metre}. 
\item Column width is \SI{80}{\milli\metre}. 
\item Spacing between columns is \SI{10}{\milli\metre}.
\item Top margin is \SI{25}{\milli\metre} (except for the first page which is \SI{30}{\milli\metre} to the title top).
\item Text height (without headers and footers) is maximum \SI{235}{\milli\metre}.
\item Page headers and footers must be left empty.
\item No page numbers.
\item Check indentations and spacing by comparing to the example PDF file.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Section headings}

Section headings are centred in boldface with the first word capitalised and the rest of the heading in lower case. Sub-headings appear like major headings, except they start at the left margin in the column. Sub-sub-headings appear like sub-headings, except they are in italics and not boldface. See the examples in this file. No more than 3 levels of headings should be used.

\subsection{Fonts}

The font used for the main text is Times. The recommended
font size is 9 points which is also the minimum allowed size.
Other font types may be used if needed for special purposes. Remember, 
however, to embed all the fonts in your final PDF file!

LaTeX users: DO NOT USE THE Computer Modern FONT FOR TEXT (Times is
specified in the style file). If possible, make the final
document using POSTSCRIPT FONTS since, for example, equations with
non-PS Computer Modern are very hard to read on screen.



\subsection{Figures}\label{sec:figures}

Figures must be centred in the column or page (if the figure spans both columns). Figures which span 2 columns must be placed at the top or bottom of a page.
Captions should follow each figure and have the format used in Fig.~\ref{fig:speech_production}. 

Figures should preferably be line drawings. If they contain gray
levels or colors, they should be checked to print well on a
high-quality non-color laser printer.
If some figures contain bitmap images, please ensure that their resolution 
is high enough to preserve readability.



\subsection{Tables}\label{sec:tables}

An example of a table is shown in Table~\ref{tab:example}. Somewhat
different styles are allowed according to the type and purpose of the
table. The caption text may be above or below the table. Tables must be legible when printed in monochrome on A4 paper. 

\begin{table}[th]
  \caption{This is an example of a table}
  \label{tab:example}
  \centering
  \begin{tabular}{ r@{}l  r }
    \toprule
    \multicolumn{2}{c}{\textbf{Ratio}} & 
                                         \multicolumn{1}{c}{\textbf{Decibels}} \\
    \midrule
    $1$                       & $/10$ & $-20$~~~             \\
    $1$                       & $/1$  & $0$~~~               \\
    $2$                       & $/1$  & $\approx 6$~~~       \\
    $3.16$                    & $/1$  & $10$~~~              \\
    $10$                      & $/1$  & $20$~~~              \\
    \bottomrule
  \end{tabular}
  
\end{table}



\subsection{Equations}

Equations should be placed on separate lines and numbered. Examples of equations are given below. Particularly,
%
%\vspace{-3mm}
\begin{equation}
x(t) = s(f_\omega(t))
\label{eq1}
\end{equation}
where \(f_\omega(t)\) is a special warping function
\begin{equation}
f_\omega(t)=\frac{1}{2\pi j}\oint_C \frac{\nu^{-1k}d\nu}
{(1-\beta\nu^{-1})(\nu^{-1}-\beta)}
\label{eq2}
\end{equation}
A residue theorem states that
\begin{equation}
\oint_C F(z)dz=2 \pi j \sum_k Res[F(z),p_k]
\label{eq3}
\end{equation}
Applying (\ref{eq3}) to (\ref{eq1}),
it is straightforward to see that
\begin{equation}
1 + 1 = \pi
\label{eq4}
\end{equation}

\subsection{Page numbering}

Final page numbers will be added later to the document electronically. {\em
Please do not include any headers or footers!}

\subsection{Style}

Manuscripts must be written in English. Either US or UK spelling is acceptable (but do not mix them).

\subsubsection{References}
\label{section:references}

It is ISCA policy that papers submitted should refer to peer-reviewed publications. References to non-peer-reviewed publications (including public repositories such as arXiv, Preprints, and HAL, software, and personal communications) should only be made if there is no peer-reviewed publication available, should be kept to a minimum, and should appear as footnotes in the text (i.e., not listed in the References).

References should be in standard IEEE format, numbered in order of appearance, for example \cite{Davis80-COP} is cited before \cite{Rabiner89-ATO}. For longer works such as books, provide a single entry for the complete work in the References, then cite specific pages \cite[pp.\ 417--422]{Hastie09-TEO} or a chapter \cite[Chapter 2]{Hastie09-TEO}. Multiple references may be cited in a list \cite{Smith22-XXX, Jones22-XXX}.

\subsubsection{International System of Units (SI)}

Use SI units, correctly formatted with a non-breaking space between the quantity and the unit. In \LaTeX\xspace this is best achieved using the \texttt{siunitx} package (which is already included by the provided \LaTeX\xspace class). This will produce
\SI{25}{\milli\second}, \SI{44.1}{\kilo\hertz} and so on.




\section{Submissions}

Information on how and when to submit your paper is provided on the conference website.

\subsection{Manuscript}

Authors are required to submit a single PDF file of each manuscript. The PDF file should comply with the following requirements: (a) no password protection; (b) all fonts must be embedded; and (c) text searchable (do ctrl-F and try to find a common word such as ``the''). The conference organisers may contact authors of non-complying files to obtain a replacement. Papers for which an acceptable replacement is not provided in a timely manner will be withdrawn.

\subsubsection{Embed all fonts}

It is \textit{very important} that the PDF file embeds all fonts!  PDF files created using \LaTeX, including on \url{https://overleaf.com}, will generally embed all fonts from the body text. However, it is possible that included figures (especially those in PDF or PS format) may use additional fonts that are not embedded, depending how they were created. 

On Windows, the bullzip printer can convert any PDF to have embedded and subsetted fonts. On Linux \& MacOS, converting to and from Postscript will embed all fonts:
\\

\noindent\textsf{pdf2ps file.pdf}\\
\noindent\textsf{ps2pdf -dPDFSETTINGS=/prepress file.ps file.pdf}





\section{Discussion}

Authors must proofread their PDF file prior to submission, to ensure it is correct. Do not rely on proofreading the \LaTeX\xspace source or Word document. \textbf{Please proofread the PDF file before it is submitted.}
